Hi,

some guys at #lad told me that you probably need beta-testers for your app. 
Although i'm not a programmer, I'm using linux for about 6 years and have been
using renoise (http://www.renoise.com) under windows for some years.
So i'd be kind if you could give me a link to the recent sources. Or should i
checkout SVN?

Greets,
samoht
